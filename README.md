Social Impact Reflection

Being able to create a list of information pulled from images of any type can have negative reprecussions. Even if this specific project just deals in cards, this has the potential to automate a process that can be used on other, more important things. When in the wrong hands, being able to read licence plates, for example, could be used to breach privacy or possibly steal identities through accessing cctv footage where people are using ids or credit cards. In order to try and prevent these possibilities, these technologies should be harder for the general populous to access- for example charging more to access the tech or making a permit accessable by companies instead of general public.
